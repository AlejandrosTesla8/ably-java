# Ably Java Client Library SDK API Reference
<p>
  The Java Client Library SDK supports a realtime and a REST interface. The Java API references are generated from the [Ably Java Client
  Library SDK source code](https://github.com/ably/ably-java/) using [JavaDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc) and structured by
  classes.
<p>
  The realtime interface enables a client to maintain a persistent connection to Ably and publish, subscribe and be present on channels. The
  REST interface is stateless and typically implemented server-side. It is used to make requests such as retrieving statistics, token
  authentication and publishing to a channel.
<p>
  View the [Ably docs](https://ably.com/docs/) for conceptual information on using Ably, and for API references featuring all languages. The
  combined [API references](https://ably.com/docs/api/) are organized by features and split between the
  [realtime](https://ably.com/docs/api/realtime-sdk) and [REST](https://ably.com/docs/api/rest-sdk) interfaces.
