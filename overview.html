<p>The Java Client Library SDK supports a realtime and a REST interface. The Java API references are generated from the <a href="https://github.com/ably/ably-java/">Ably Java Client Library SDK source code</a> using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc">JavaDoc</a> and structured by classes.</p>
<p>The realtime interface enables a client to maintain a persistent connection to Ably and publish, subscribe and be present on channels. The REST interface is stateless and typically implemented server-side. It is used to make requests such as retrieving statistics, token authentication and publishing to a channel.</p>
<p>View the <a href="https://ably.com/docs/">Ably docs</a> for conceptual information on using Ably, and for API references featuring all languages. The combined <a href="https://ably.com/docs/api/">API references</a> are organized by features and split between the <a href="https://ably.com/docs/api/realtime-sdk">realtime</a> and <a href="https://ably.com/docs/api/rest-sdk">REST</a> interfaces.</p>
